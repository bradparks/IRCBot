# IRC Bot

Here are two IRC bots, TrollBot (bot.js) and Richard Stallman bot (richard.js). They both do two different things so feel free to mess with both of them.

## Requirements

You must either have this installed, or cloned in the same directory as IRC Bot

    https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc

You must also have NodeJS installed

    http://nodejs.org/

## How To Run

First, edit the bot config for the channel and IRC server you want it to run on in the code, then in terminal type:

    node bot.js

### Todo

Add 3-part random buzz phrase generator
